        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
        <p>
            This basic muffin is not your stir-it-gently, dense, fruit-and-nut-filled health muffin. Instead, it's a beat-it-up, cake-type muffin, high-crowned and very "vanilla-looking." This is a great muffin for kids (young or old) who don't want a lot of "stuff" in their muffins. With its basic sugar-cinnamon-nutmeg flavor, it's more reminiscent of a plain doughnut (without the deep-fat frying) than anything else.

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <strong>Batter</strong>
            <li>4 tablespoons (57g) butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (99g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (71g) brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 to 1 1/4 teaspoons nutmeg, to taste</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 2/3 cups (320g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (227g) milk</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <strong>Topping</strong>
            <li>3 tablespoons (43g) butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (39g) cinnamon sugar*</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Lightly grease a standard muffin tin. Or line with 12 paper or silicone muffin cups, and grease the cups with non-stick vegetable oil spray; this will ensure that they peel off the muffins nicely.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream together the butter, vegetable oil, and sugars till smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, beating to combine.</li>
            <li>Stir in the baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Stir the flour into the butter mixture alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour and making sure everything is thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared pan, filling the cups nearly full.</li>
            <li>Bake the muffins for 15 to 17 minutes, or until they're a pale golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the middle of one of the center muffins comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove them from the oven, and let them cool for a couple of minutes, or until you can handle them. While they're cooling, melt the butter for the topping (this is easily done in the microwave).</li>
            <li>Use a pastry brush to paint the top of each muffin with the butter, then sprinkle with the cinnamon-sugar. Or simply dip the tops of muffins into the melted butter, then roll in the cinnamon-sugar.</li>
            <li>Serve warm, or cool on a rack and wrap airtight. Store for a day or so at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
