        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
        <p>
            This cornbread is a rare compromise between Southern and Northern cornbreads: it's "just right," as far as the amount of sugar. It's tender and moist, with pleasing corn flavor.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups (210g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (156g) cornmeal</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (283g) lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, melted, cooled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" square or round pan (a cast-iron skillet will work fine, too), shallow 1 1/2 quart casserole dish, or 12 muffin cups.</li>
            <li>Weigh your flour and cornmeal; or measure each by gently spooning into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the milk, melted butter, vegetable oil, and egg.</li>
            <li>Pour the liquid all at once into the flour mixture, stirring quickly and gently until just combined. Don't over mix: stir the batter just enough to bring it together and evenly moisten the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan, or scoop into the muffin tin.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges just begin to pull away from the pan and a cake tester or paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack for 5 minutes before cutting; serve warm.</li>
            <li>Store any leftovers, well wrapped, at cool room temperature for a few days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
